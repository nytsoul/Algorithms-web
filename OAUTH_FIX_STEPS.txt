=== GOOGLE OAUTH FIX: Error 400 redirect_uri_mismatch ===

PROBLEM:
Google rejected the login because the redirect URL doesn't match their records.

YOUR EXACT REDIRECT URIs TO ADD IN GOOGLE CLOUD CONSOLE:
================================================

1. For Development (Primary):
   http://localhost:5173/dashboard

2. For Supabase Callback:
   https://tuhjfziufhfcjdvthaaj.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback

STEPS TO FIX:
============

1. Open: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

2. Find and click your OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Web application)

3. Scroll down to "Authorized redirect URIs"

4. CLEAR ALL existing URIs

5. ADD THESE TWO URIs (copy-paste exactly):
   - http://localhost:5173/dashboard
   - https://tuhjfziufhfcjdvthaaj.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback

6. Click SAVE

7. Copy your:
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret

8. Go to Supabase: https://app.supabase.com/project/tuhjfziufhfcjdvthaaj/auth/providers

9. Click the GOOGLE provider button

10. Paste your Client ID and Client Secret

11. Click SAVE

12. Go back to: http://localhost:5173

13. Try "Sign up with Google" again


DEBUGGING IF STILL NOT WORKING:
==============================

Open Browser Console (Press F12) and look for:
  "[Auth] Window origin: http://localhost:5173"
  "[Auth] Redirect URL being sent to Google: http://localhost:5173/dashboard"

Copy-paste that exact redirect URL into Google Cloud Console.

If you see a different URL (like http://127.0.0.1:5173), use THAT URL instead.


COMMON MISTAKES:
================
✗ Forgot to click SAVE in Google Console
✗ Typed the URL wrong (case-sensitive!)
✗ Used 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost
✗ Forgot the /dashboard path
✗ Used https:// when it should be http://
✗ Didn't wait after saving before testing
